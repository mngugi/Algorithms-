Algorithm is a sequence of steps that describe how a problem can be solved.Every computer program that ends with a result is a result of an Algorithm.

### Basics of Algorithms
**Categories of Algorithms**

    Search − search an item in a data structure.

    Sort −   sort items in a certain order.

    Insert − insert item in a data structure.

    Update − update an existing item in a data structure.

    Delete − delete an existing item from a data structure.

### Algorithm to Add 2 numbers and Print Results

```HTML
Step 1 − Start a program. /** Write program title and purpose **/
Step 2 − declare three integers. a, b & c. /**int, float or double **/
Step 3 − define values of a & b. /** a,b,c are variables difine value types **/
Step 4 − add values of a & b . /**(a+b)**/
Step 5 − store output of step 4 to c. /**c=(a+b)**/
Step 6 − print c. /**println("Answer", +c )**/
Step 7 − STOP

**Algorithm to Find Factorial Number**
Step 1 - START
Step 2 - Initialize a variable to hold the factorial result, let's call it "factorial", and set it to n = 5  
Step 3 - Start a loop from 1 to 5 (inclusive). Let's call the loop variable "i".
Step 4 - iterate over a range of numbers from 1 to 6 . since the first index is 0 
Step 5 - Inside the loop, multiply "factorial" by "i".
Step 6 - After the loop is completed, the value of "factorial" will hold the value of 5!.
Step 7 - Output the value of "factorial" to the user. 

```python
factorial = 1
for i in range(1, 6):
    factorial = factorial * i

print(factorial)

```
